Make high unque scinetfic calculator using html and css

That sounds like a great project! Creating a unique and highly functional scientific calculator in a single HTML file is challenging but rewarding.

I've designed a highly responsive, unique-looking "Quantum Console" calculator using Tailwind CSS. It features a dark, vibrant aesthetic and includes a comprehensive set of scientific functions, parentheses, memory storage, and a Degree/Radian toggle.

Here is the single HTML file for the scientific calculator:
Quantum Console Scientific Calculator
14 Nov, 16:26

This file provides a stylish, highly functional scientific calculator. I used the Inconsolata font for the display to give it that unique "console" feel, and carefully implemented the scientific functions, factorial, and the crucial degree/radian mode toggle. Let me know if you want to explore any specific feature, like adding hyperbolic functions or changing the color scheme!
